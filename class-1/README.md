# FEW 1.2 - Class 1

Learn JavaScript by making games! 

You're hired! Consider this class your job for the next 7 weeks. You'll be respobsinble for making three games, maintaining and improving the code base for your games, keeping notes and documentation for the code that you produce. 

It's your job to put in regular hours working on the code you produce. 

You'll be making three games:

- Break Out
- Oregon Trail
- A game of your own design using Phaser JS

You will also keep a JS notebook. This will be a GitHub repo where you will keep notes, questions, and other useful information about JavaScript. 

## Getting started

The tutorial here is short. You should be able to finish it in an evening. 

## Homework

Read the tutorial and complete the game. You can copy and paste the code samples. Your tutorial should be functional! Test your work and play the game. 

Study the code and and do your best to understand how the code functions and why the game behaves as it does. Look closely at the game, be sure to play. Change some of the values and see how they effect the game. 

After completing the tutorial You will be working on challenges based on the tutorial. This is why it is essential that your tutorial be functioning when you come to class 2.
