## Getting started

### The local server and CORS

Before getting started we need to understand web browsers, security, and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing or [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS). 
CORS is an issue you will run into often working with JavaScript as your applications get more complex. 
In short the browser puts limits to what files can be accessed via JavaScript in the browser. 

To test Phaser locally you'll need to run a local server. Follow the guide here:
